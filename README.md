How the game works:
1) Race prompt
- “q”/Ctrl-D causes the program to terminate
- “s, d, v, g, t” (race selection) causes the game to start 
2) Playing the game
- "no, so, ea, we, ne, nw, se, sw" moves the PC in the specified direction
- "u direction" uses the potion in the specified direction
- "a direction" attacks if there is enemy in the specified direction
- "f" stops enemies from moving until f is pressed again
- "r" restarts the game
- PC and stairs are blue, enemies are red, potions are green and gold is yellow
- Next floor is reached when player reaches the stairs denoted by "\\"
- You win the game when the fifth floor is reached
- You lose the game when your HP reaches 0

To start playing:
1) Clone this repository
2) Run ./cc3k input.txt
3) That's it! Good luck escaping the dungeon :)
